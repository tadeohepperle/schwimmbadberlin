# A platform for finding and comparing public swimming pools in berlin

The purpose of this project was to create a platform that is capable of displaying opening times, prices, features and locations of public swimming pools in Berlin. This would make it easier to find fun free time activities if you are into swimming.

Once I ran into the problem that a friend of mine and me wanted to find a good public swimming pool with a wellness area and cheap entrance prices. It was hard to look through so many websites, so I made one by myself to make all the information easily accessable.

The project can be found hosted on <a href="https://www.schwimmbadberlin.de/">www.schwimmbadberlin.de<a>
